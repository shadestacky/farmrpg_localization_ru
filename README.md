**FarmRPG Localization Project**

This is a TamperMonkey script which aims to localize FarmRPG (the web version) to Russian language. 
***(Currently very WIP and does not function!!)***

I thought about doing this for so long and finally decided to try doing it. 
I may not know what exactly am I doing, but hopefully it turns out to be something decent :P
